# Hans-Günther Biermann's Report

## Introduction
    During my internship in Basel, I was tasked with integrating a Niryo Ned3 Pro robot into a quality check line. The main goal was to sort chemical products in vials between safe and unsafe categories (classified according to their color) and place the safe ones in a packaging line, which will be created by a french fellow that worked with me on the global project.

    The robot was equipped with a conveyor belt with an IR sensor to detect the presence of a vial. The robot was also equipped with a  customized gripper to pick and place the vials. To check the safety of each vial, we created a testing zone composed by a standard camera and a plate. The camera is pluged to a Raspberry Pi where the safety testing is proceed. The camera view is displayed to a screen with some logs via an HDMI cable. 

    To perform that I will propose two ROS2 packages, that will handle both robot's and raspberry's tasks.
